📚 LibraSearch - Intelligent Library Management System
📌 Overview

LibraSearch is an optimized Library Management System that streamlines book allocation, user requests, and deallocation processes. The system implements key DAA and DSA algorithms such as sorting, searching, greedy allocation, and dynamic programming to enhance efficiency. It also uses MySQL for structured book and user record management.

🚀 Features

✅ Efficient Book Search & Allocation using optimized sorting and searching algorithms
✅ Greedy Allocation Strategy for better book distribution among users
✅ Structured MySQL Database for fast and reliable book and user management
✅ File Handling System for maintaining transaction logs and historical records
✅ Dynamic Programming Concepts to improve computational efficiency

🛠 Tech Stack

Languages: C
Database: MySQL
Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming
Concepts: File Handling, Data Structures & Algorithms

📊 System Workflow

1️⃣ User Requests a Book → Search Algorithm finds the book quickly
2️⃣ Availability Check → If available, Greedy Allocation assigns the book
3️⃣ Book Issued & Database Updated → Book count is reduced
4️⃣ Return or Deallocation → System updates inventory and pending requests
5️⃣ Optimized Searching & Sorting → Ensures fast book retrieval
